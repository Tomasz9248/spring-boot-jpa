# spring-boot-jpa

Repository contains my learning of Spring framework and Spring Boot which is in progress.
Each commit is accompanied by commentary to help figure out and interiorize how it works.
The goal is to understand Spring and Spring Boot in order to create own REST api project with separete back-end and front-end layer.
