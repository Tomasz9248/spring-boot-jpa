# spring-boot-jpa

Repository contains my learning of Spring framework and Spring Boot which is in progress.<br>
Each commit is accompanied by commentary to help figure out and interiorize how it works.<br>
The goal is to understand Spring and Spring Boot in order to create own REST api project with separate back-end and front-end layer.<br>
